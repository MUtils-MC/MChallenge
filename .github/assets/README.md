MChallenges provides a variety of modifications (``challenges``) to change up your gameplay experience.<br>
Challenges can make the game **harder**, more **interesting**, or just plain **silly**. 
Or everything at once!



▪ Part from [**MUtils**](https://mutils.net)<br>
▪ Works perfectly with [**MTimer**](https://modrinth.com/project/timer) to count your time & death punishments!

This project started in 2021 and quickly evolved into us finding the limits of plugins with the curiosity how you can modify Minecraft to don't lose fun beating it. 
We hope you will have the same fun while playing like us!

# 🎯 Challenges
Each challenge can be toggled and configured individually inside the Challenge menu (``/challenge``).<br>
All challenges can be combined and played in multiplayer or singleplayer (some require at least two players).<br>
You have an idea for a new Challenge?
We would be happy to hear it in our [discord](https://dc.mutils.net)!

## 🔌 API & Challenge Addons
MChallenge provides a feature rich environment for Challenges with GUI's, settings menus and saving and more.
You can add your own Challenges to the Addon Category in a few seconds!

▪ [Challenge addon template](https://github.com/MUtils-MC/MChallenge-Addon)<br>
▪ If you want to publish your addon, please notify me on Discord, so I can add it to our [list](https://mutils.net/ch/addons) :)

If you want to inject into the Challenge lifecycle or even manipulate it with your own plugin, you can access the [**API**](https://github.com/MUtils-MC/MChallenge-API):
```kts
dependencies {
    compileOnly("de.miraculixx:challenge-api:1.5.0")
}
```
NOTE: The Challenge flow and registration are very strict and carefully crafted to allow this amount of content without a performance impact.
Challenge code and data only load when the challenge starts and is unloaded after stopping.

The project is open source :)<br>
If you want to take a look and maybe even find improvements, we would be happy to hear back!
